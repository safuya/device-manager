# Device Manager
## Summary
This website allows you to manage devices.

## Running the Development Server
You must first set a session secret in your environment.
```
export session_secret='my_really_long_random_secret'
```

You can use bundle to install the required gems, and run the required
migrations.
```
bundle
rake db:migrate
```

After this, you can bring up the server with shotgun. You can seed the database
beforehand.
```
rake db:seed
shotgun
```

## Running the Tests
Run all tests using rspec.
```
rspec
```

## Installing in Production
Set up an AWS account. You then need to
[install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
and [configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
the AWS CLI.

Next, [install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html)
the Elastic Beanstalk CLI.

Set up and record your session secret.

```
export session_secret=$(ruby -e "require 'sysrandom/securerandom'; puts SecureRandom.hex(64)")
echo $session_secret
```

Configure your production database. Edit the user in the seed if you want to
change the default user.

```
rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=production
rake db:seed
git add --all
git commit -m "deploy to production"
```

Initialize elastic beanstalk and create your environment. For the environment choose
Ruby 2.3 (Passenger Standalone).

```
eb init
eb create production -s --envvars SINATRA_ENV=production,session_secret=$session_secret
```

Visit your newly deployed website and change the username and password of the
initial user.
```
eb open
```

Future deployments can be carried out with the deploy command. Database
migrations for production must be carried out with your production session
secret. Unless you move your database to a separate EC2 instance, the database
will also be emptied on each deployment.
```
eb deploy
```
